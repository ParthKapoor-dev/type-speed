<p> This is the first version of TYPE SPEED. made by Vanila JS </p>
<p> The user types the given line in the input box and it is highlighted when it is correctly written. </p>
<p> THE ISSUES </p>
<p> 1) The most important issue is that whenever the same word is repeated in the sentense only the first occurrence is highlighted </p>
<p> 2) The data remains same throughout the session i.e. an API needs to be applied to change the sentense every single time </p>
<p> 3) It only shows time taken and not wrm or any other analysis </p>
<p> Note that all these issues will be solved in the next branch versions </p>
